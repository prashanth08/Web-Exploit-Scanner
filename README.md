 In this project, a HTTP proxy was implemented which can interact with a virtual machine and replay contents from a server(web page) and detect if it is malicious or not. This web exploit scanner can detect malicious websites/domains and report it back to the client browser. The HTTP proxy will handle connections to the client (browser), server (web page) and virtual machine via sockets. It keeps track of the web pages parsed in a local file cache (~64KB).
